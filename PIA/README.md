So much people need help so focus on the homeworks that we must do, almost all the task, we procrastinate all those things, most of the people do that, said that have more time and finally, he end doing it too late, bad and with a lot of stress in the process, that’s why I made this program, trying to help a little bit with that problem.

The program ask you the time that you have free to make all those task, giving the name of that task, the difficulty that you would give it and the time that you believe that it going to takes you, finally the program will give the order that you should do all your tasks.

All the code was made under the next thinking about the procedure to give an order of the tasks.

The better way to start to do the activities of the day, are not an only way, there exist two:
The first one is making the homework most easy (if it exist), because it is easy, you will not take too much time on this or don’t going to take you so much energy, but, how to know which is the homework most easily? Here, the only way is comparing with the other activities, one of them will be this option and for help choose one, the program have an scale that said how can you identify the order of the difficulty.

The second way and the most common is doing the harder, start doing the most difficult things is an strategy to attack the main problem, when we finish the main problem the rest of the problems will not take us too much time.


Functionality
This project is divided in two programs; one for make the text files and give and save the order to make the tasks, the second one is going to read all this information and present to you in the order that you are supposed to do like the logistic of the principal idea.

Main.c use an structure to save information and then used in other parts of the program, also use functions to make some essential process using the structure and saving the information and passed to other function, make the files that need and put there the information and finally creating a new text file that will need the second program.

Tasks.c is the second program, it is a reader, find the information saved on the text files made for the first program, also has the order to say if you have not time to finish the task with the supposed time that you give. This code contains other function of saving, for example, if you are supposed that you close the program and you didn’t finish all the task that you put there, the code save this information and when you run again the program it will start in the place that you left and when you finish all the activities, also the program finish too.

Reference:
The bones of the structure part was taked from the code of the homework 7 of the course of structure programming, it is on this repository: "C/Homeworks/Homework7/functions.h"
